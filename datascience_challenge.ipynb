    "#### Purpose  \n",
    "This notebook (written in Python 3) is intended to address \n",
    "a Data Science challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Candidate    \n",
    "Andrea Chiappo  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem  \n",
    "_Is it possible to fill 10 backpacks with 20 different size boxes?_  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:  \n",
    "- two different box types: type A and type B  \n",
    "- boxes have different sizes  \n",
    "- backpacks capacity differs  \n",
    "- box timing: boxes at the end of the truck might be better  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution    \n",
    "I propose two possible solutions to this Data Science challenge:  \n",
    "a methodic one and a pragmatic one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methodic solution  \n",
    "The problem at hand resembles the so-called _Knapsack Problem_ \n",
    "with three additional levels of complexity:   \n",
    "- the presence of 10 backpacks of different capacity  \n",
    "- the presence of two classes of boxes (typeA and typeB)  \n",
    "- the presence of a time ordering condition to the boxing order  \n",
    "\n",
    "From a strict interpretation of the problem statement above, we can temporarily \n",
    "neglect the last two points above. Considering only the need to allocate the 20 \n",
    "boxes into 10 different backpacks, a solution can be obtained by implementing a \n",
    "\"recursive\" version of the **0-1 Knapsack Problem**:  \n",
    "assigning to each box a size and a value and ordering the 10 backpacks' \n",
    "capacity in a given sequence, we start by applying the _0-1 Knapsack problem_ \n",
    "solution recipe assuming the first capacity of the sequence and using all 20 \n",
    "boxes. Once the first backpack is filled - the maximum available space has been \n",
    "occupied - we can repeat the procedure, adopting only the remaining boxes and \n",
    "the second backpack. The process is repeated until all backpacks have been used. \n",
    "The upshot will be a series of backpacks filled to a certain degree, as \n",
    "quantified by the maximum value obtained via the _0-1 Knapsack_ routine, and a \n",
    "set of unallocated boxes. Summing the former quantities gives the total \n",
    "performance of the allocation process.  \n",
    "This procedure does not necessarily produce the most efficient outcome. \n",
    "To search for other, more performing possibilities, we can shuffle the order of \n",
    "the backpacks - thus their capacity - and repeat the procedure above from the \n",
    "beginning, each time recording the global (cumulative) maximum value obtained \n",
    "via the _0-1 Knapsack_ procedure. In the end, the sequence of backpacks which \n",
    "yields the highest cumulative value represents the best performing choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The time ordering on the boxes and the two class labels can be reintroduced \n",
    "adding the features to the data. Using this information at the end of the \n",
    "process above, one can group the boxes following their time affinity and class \n",
    "membership; inserting this criteria during the boxes allocation procedure above \n",
    "might affect the efficiency of the process. At this point, one can identify \n",
    "which sequence of backpacks yields the best trade-off between the size-value \n",
    "allocation performance and the time or class grouping of the boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pragmatic solution  \n",
    "A _brute force_ solution could entail exploring all possible allocations \n",
    "by simulating the scenarios. In this case, one would compute all possible \n",
    "combinations of boxes $\\binom nk$ and detect the ones which, for a given \n",
    "capacity, occupy to large space available. This approach, on one hand, \n",
    "might more easily accommodate the time ordering condition and should \n",
    "perform well when small quantities (number of boxes and backpacks) are \n",
    "involved. However, its performance might quickly escalate as the number \n",
    "of elements involved grows. On the other hand, the _Methodic solution_ \n",
    "presented above, scale as $O(nWur)$, with $n$ the number of boxes, $W$ \n",
    "the capacity of each backpack, $u$ the number of backpacks (assuming, for \n",
    "simplicity that all have $\\sim W$) and $r$ the number of reshufflings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical example  \n",
    "Below is displayed a numerical example of the implementation of the \n",
    "_Methodic solution_ presented above. The starting point is a definition \n",
    "of the function implementing the _0-1 Knapsack problem_ algorithm. For \n",
    "a given capacity of the backpack, a number of boxes and the arrays \n",
    "containing the sizes and values of the boxes, this function returns \n",
    "the indices of the boxes, and the corresponding cumulative value, that \n",
    "can be allocated inside the backpack."
