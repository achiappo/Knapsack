## Solution to an enriched Knapsack-like problem

### Problem statement

#### Efficient Allocation

Filling 10 backpacks with 20 different size boxes might seem a common  
task but different variables have to be considered to achieve this.

#### Boxes characteristics:

• Boxex have different size and value  
• Boxes have different timing label  
• Boxes have either type A or type B label  
• Backpacks have different capacity
